We did not change anything from our logical design as we believe that our logical design is already in Boyce-Codd Normal Form.

For what we changed in logical design, we fixed some mistakes that did not follow the proper syntax. Also, we changed the names of some the foreign key attibutes in waste_management, energy_management, and carbon_emission target that refers to the city primary key in order to avoid future confusion between the foreign keys.
